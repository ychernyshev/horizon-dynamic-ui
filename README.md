# horizon-dynamic-ui
Horizon Dynamic UI is a JavaScript micro-framework for building dynamic, declarative web interfaces without the need for a backend or build tools. Designed with developer simplicity and architectural clarity in mind, Horizon allows you to configure scenes, layouts, and components like a stage director â€” just mount, structure, and improvise.
